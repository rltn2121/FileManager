I added shortcuts at 'View - Detail(Alt + D)' and 'List(Alt + L)' and 'Help - Shortcuts(F1)'.
I also added 'Clip Board' label under the panel which display detail information of last selected file.
You can check which file(or directory) is in the clip board.
I added 'Key Event' at table and list.
You can go into lower directory by pressing 'Enter' key and go to upper directory by pressing 'Backspace' key.
You can open file(or directory) not only double clicking the list, but also press 'Enter' key.


JTree is imperfect(It doesn't updated).
